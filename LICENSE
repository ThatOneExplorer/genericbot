                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) [2025]  [ThatOneExplorer]

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users’ freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

  “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

  To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

  A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.

  To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.

  An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
form of a work.

  A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of

a physical or digital medium for making copies of the work, and (b)  
is not part of that work.  For example, a Standard Interface  
includes common system libraries that do not normally need to be  
linked with the program.  

  The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means  
all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable  
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to  
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work’s  
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free  
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but  
which are not part of the work.  

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users  
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding  
Source.  

  2. Basic Permissions.  

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of  
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated  
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited  
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a  
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its  
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your  
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not  
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains  
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose  
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you  
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with  
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do  
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works  
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction  
and control; and they receive no rights or rights of use from you.  

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under  
the conditions stated below.  

  3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological  
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article  
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar  
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.  

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid  
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention  
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to  
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or  
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s  
users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of  
technological measures.  

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you  
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;  
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any  
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;  
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all  
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,  
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to  
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the  
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified  
    it, and giving a relevant date.  

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is  
    released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License  
    to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will,  
    therefore, apply to the whole of the work, and all its parts,  
    regardless of how they are packaged.  

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display  
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has no  
    interactive user interfaces, your work need not make them.  

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent  
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,  
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,  
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an  
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not  
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users  
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work  
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other  
parts of the aggregate.  

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of  
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the  
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,  
unless the recipient already has it.  

  You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along  
with the object code.  If the place of conveyance is a network server,  
you must provide access to the Corresponding Source in a manner  
effectively equivalent to providing physical copies.  If only  
exceptional circumstances prevent you from doing so, you must keep  
reasonable legal rights to forbid recipients from copying the  
Corresponding Source.  

  7. Additional Terms.  

  “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this  
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  If  
additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that is  
treated as if they were included in the Program as separate  
terms of license, but any grant of additional permissions to the  
whole Program applies also to each recipient as a whole.  

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you  
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of  
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the  
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or  
    author attributions in that material; or  

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material; or  

    d) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some  
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  

    e) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that  
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of  
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, or  
    any other liability that these contractual assumptions might impose;  

    f) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or  
    authors of the material; or  

    g) Declining to grant rights under patent law except as provided  
    in section 11; or  

    h) Requiring acceptance of warranty or liability terms, if  
    reasonable, for a particular party.  

  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a  
notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a  
term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If you  
remove such a term, you may not distribute the material under the  
License unless you replace it with a term that permits the same uses  
under this License.  If you distribute the material in a way that is  
otherwise prohibited under this License, you may not do so at all.  

  8. Termination.  

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly  
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or  
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under  
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third  
paragraph of section 11).  

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your  
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (except as  
expressly provided above).  Moreover, your license from a particular  
copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder  
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means before  
3 years after the violation.  

  Furthermore, prosecution of any patent infringement claim against  
any recipient of the Program that is infringing makes the patent  
licenses from such recipient to the Program terminate automatically.  

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or  
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work  
occurs automatically when you run a copy of the Program.  

  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to  
propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright  
if you do not accept this License.  

  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate  
your acceptance of this License to do so.  

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically  
receives a license from the original licensors to run, modify and  
propagate that work, subject to this License.  

  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties  
with this License.  

  11. Patents.  

  A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this  
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  

  The work thus licensed is granted a patent license from each  
contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise  
run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.  

  However, patents held by contributors are not licensed if the  
contributor actually infringes them by making, using, selling,  
offering for sale, importing or otherwise transferring the work,  
except as part of that work.  

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,  
and not intending to grant others rights under that patent license,  
then any patent license you grant is automatically terminated.  

  If you convey a covered work and grant a patent license to some of  
its recipients, then the patent license is automatically extended to  
all recipients of the work and works based on it.  

  Patents cannot be leveraged to discriminate against recipients of  
the Program.  

  12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.  

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  

  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously  
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,  
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have  
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed  
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single  
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this  
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,  
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,  
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the  
combination as such.  

  14. Revised Versions of this License.  

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions  
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions  
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in  
detail to address new problems or concerns.  

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the  
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General  
Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the  
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered  
version or of any later version published by the Free Software  
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the  
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published  
by the Free Software Foundation.  

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions  
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public  
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to  
choose that version for the Program.  

  Later license versions may give you additional or different  
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any  
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a  
later version.  

                       NO WARRANTY  

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.  

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY  
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT  
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY  
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,  
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM  
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF  
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  

  16. Limitation of Liability.  

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS  
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY  
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE  
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF  
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD  
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),  
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF  
SUCH DAMAGES.  

                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest  
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  
the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  

    Copyright (C) [year]  [your name]  

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify  
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or  
    (at your option) any later version.  

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the  
    GNU General Public License for more details.  

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License  
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
